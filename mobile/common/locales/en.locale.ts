            faq1: {
                question: "How Dossa secure data exchange?",
                answer: "When a dossant (Dossa user) submits incidents, Dossa opens a connection to our virtual private network, which enhances the user's security on public Wi-Fi, noisy internet service providers, and from man-in-the-middle attacks.  Also, all data sending or receiving through Dossa are through HTTPS, which provides end-to-end encryption between our services and the mobile application."
            },
            faq2: {
                question: "How Dossa maintain users' anonymity?",
                answer: "Dossa does not store private citizens' data points such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, or postal addresses. Dossa does not track or log activities, and users do not engage in direct communication as in no correspondence.  When users turn rogue, their associates' identities remain safe and protected in the worst case."
            },
            faq3: {
                question: "How is Dossa transparent?",
                answer: "Dossa provides a form of computer-mediated transparency in which computerized systems are used to provide objective information to the public.  We hope to stimulate public officials and institutions to perform better or prevent corruption with information.  Therefore, resulting in more democratic and more affluent societies."
            },
            faq4: {
                question: "Do dossants engage in direct anti-corruption activities?",
                answer: "No! Dossa does not endorse users to confront the corrupt directly.  Instead, dossants must focus on promoting data transparency.  Dossants must only collect, analyze, and publish their abstract findings.  It is up to the open societies and more prominent anti-corruption organizations, such as the Transparency International, to further investigate and act."
